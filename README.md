Task 1:
Create a Simple Landing Page:

Use HTML to structure the page with the following sections:
Header: Include a project title and a navigation menu (links can be placeholders for now).
Main Section: Write a short description of your project, its purpose, and key features (e.g., "This is a MERN stack project showcasing my skills").
Footer: Add contact information or placeholder text like "© 2025 Your Name".
Style the Page with CSS:

Add some basic styling:
Use a modern font (e.g., Google Fonts).
Add colors for the header, footer, and background.
Style the layout to be visually appealing.
Make it Responsive:

Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to make the layout adjust for different screen sizes.
Test it on both desktop and mobile views.
Optional: Add a favicon and customize the tab title to reflect your project name.

Deliverables:
Share your code or GitHub repository link once you’re done.
Let me know if you face any issues or need help while coding.
Good luck! Let me know when you're ready for feedback or the next task.
